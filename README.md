ðŸ“„ Document Management System (University Project)
This is a collaborative project developed during my 3rd year at university as part of a two-person team. The system focuses on key document management functionalities such as searching, access requests, signing, and editing documents. It features a user-friendly interface that connects seamlessly to a MySQL database.

ðŸ›  My Contributions:
Developed document signing and editing services using Spring Boot (RESTful APIs).


ðŸ§° Technologies Used:
Java + Spring Boot (REST APIs)

MySQL

HTML/CSS/JavaScript [or React/Vue/etc. â€” adjust as appropriate]

[Optional: Swagger for API documentation, Postman for testing]

This project gave me hands-on experience in full-stack development and real-world service design, combining backend services with a responsive frontend.
